The price is pretty high for the quantity, but overall the experience was fine. The quality of food is nice but nothing extraordinary. They also have buffet(only veg)'), ('Rated 3.0', 'RATED\\n  I felt good is little expensive for the quantity they serve and In terms of taste is decent. There is nothing much to talk about the ambience, regular casual dining restaurant where you can take your family for dinner or lunch. If they improve on that quantity or may be reduce the price a bit or may be improve the presentation of the food it might Manage to get more repeat customers.'), ('Rated 4.0', 'RATED\\n  I was looking for a quite place to spend some time with family and as well wanted to try some new place.

They gave us complementary drink and momos before the buffet. The momos were really good.\\nThe number of varieties first of all was very disappointing. The service was very slow. They refilled the food very slowly. The starters were okay. The main course also was so so. There was two gravies with roti and some rice with raitha. They had chats, sev puri and pan puri, which was average. But the desert was disappointing. They had gulab Jamun and chocolate cake. The jamun was not cooked inside.
